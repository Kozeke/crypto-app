# cryptonomicon
## Project Description
Vue.js project, which manages a list of cryptocurrency tickers, utilizes WebSockets for real-time updates. The user interface is built with Vue.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and clean design. Users can add new tickers by entering the ticker symbol in an input field and clicking the "Add" button, which then displays the ticker in a list with a placeholder for its price. Each ticker in the list can be deleted with a "Delete" button. This application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Vue.js.
